# 🚀 Redis Queue System Boilerplate
### *(BullMQ + Docker + Node.js)*

A minimal, beginner-friendly **queue system boilerplate** built with Node.js, Express.js, BullMQ, and Redis (Dockerized).

> Designed to help you quickly understand and implement **background job processing** in real-world applications.

---

## 📌 Features

- ⚡ Queue system powered by BullMQ
- 🔄 Background workers for async processing
- 🐳 Redis setup using Docker
- 🎯 Priority-based job execution
- 🌐 Simple REST API to push jobs
- 🧩 Easy to extend for real-world use cases

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| Node.js | Backend runtime |
| Express.js | API server |
| BullMQ | Queue management |
| Redis | Job storage & processing |
| Docker | Containerized Redis |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scilentvishal/queuesystem.git
cd queuesystem
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
npm install
3️⃣ Start Redis (Docker)
Make sure Docker is installed and running:

bash
docker-compose -f redis-spawn.yml up -d
Services Started:

🟥 Redis → localhost:6379

📊 Redis Insight → http://localhost:5540

4️⃣ Redis Connection Configuration ⚠️
👉 If running Node.js locally:

json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 6379
}
👉 If running Node.js inside Docker:

Replace localhost with Docker service name:

json
{
  "host": "redis",
  "port": 6379
}
5️⃣ Run the Server
bash
node file.js
6️⃣ Run the Worker
bash
node user.js
📡 API Usage
➤ Add Job to Queue
Endpoint: POST /queue

Request Body:

json
{
  "taskName": "video-processing",
  "userId": "123",
  "priority": 1
}
🧠 How It Works
API receives request

Job is added to Redis queue

Worker picks job from queue

Worker processes task asynchronously

Job gets completed

⚡ Priority System
Lower number = Higher priority

Example: 1 (high) > 10 (low)

🧪 Example Use Cases
🎬 Video processing

🖼️ Image compression

📧 Email sending

🔔 Background notifications

📊 Report generation

⚠️ Notes
Jobs are persistent in Redis

Worker restart may reprocess incomplete jobs

Use removeOnComplete in production

Always make job processing idempotent

📈 Future Improvements
Retry mechanism

Dead letter queue

Job status tracking API

Dashboard integration (Bull Board)

Rate limiting
